Perform two MD simulations 
===========================

Simulate the behavior of two Lennard-Jones-systems (Argon, 108 atoms, T =140 K 
:math:`\rho_1 = 0.095~g/cm^3` and :math:`\rho_2 = 1.050~g/cm^3`) with our developed MD program. 
Simulate for 4000 timesteps and estimate when the equilibrium is reached by plotting the 
total energy and temperature. Explain your decision process. Furthermore calculate the 
average kinetic, potential and total energy when the equilibrium is reached. Plot for 
both equilibrated systems the redial distribution function by using TRAVIS. Compare the 
pair distribution functions. What kind of structural changes can be observed and what 
kind of physical states are we simulating? Explain which system represents which physical state.
