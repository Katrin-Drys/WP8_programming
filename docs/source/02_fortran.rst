Fortran basics
==============

Programming is the art of precisely telling a computer what to do, usually to perform an 
action or solve a problem which would be too difficult to do by hand. It thus involves the 
following steps: 

1. **Problem definition**: What do you want to achieve?
2. **Algorithm design**: How can you achieve it?
3. **Implementation**: Translate the algorithm into a programming language.
4. **Testing**: Compile and run the program to see if it works.
5. **Debugging**: Fix any errors that occur.
6. **Data analysis**: Interpret the results only after verifying the program's correctness.

In this chapter, we will introduce you to the basics of the Fortran programming language.
We will start with the basic syntax and structure of a Fortran program, and then move on to
some easy coding examples.
